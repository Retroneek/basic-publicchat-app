# basic-publicchat-app:
 
basic-publicchat-app, or known as "Project Lumera" is an in-progress real-time chat application built with <a href='https://sanic.dev/api/sanic.app.html#getting-started'>Sanic<a> and <a href='https://websockets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html'>WebSockets<a>. Designed for speed and efficiency, this project aims to provide a simple yet robust platform for instant messaging and communication.

# Key Dependencies:
Sanic: A fast, asynchronous Python web framework that powers the backend. </br>
WebSockets: Enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.

# Purpose:
Lumera was created to build up my experience with WebSockets and backend development. This project is my hands-on approach to focusing on real-time communication and server-side programming. I wanted a challenge that would push me beyond the basics, diving deep into the complexities of building a scalable, efficient backend. Lumera is my journey into understanding how to manage WebSocket connections, optimize performance, and tackle the advanced aspects of backend architecture. It’s a personal project that’s all about learning, experimenting, and sharing with others the things I create.
